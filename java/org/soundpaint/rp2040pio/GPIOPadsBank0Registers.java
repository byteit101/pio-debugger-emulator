/**
 * Facade to the internal GPIO Pads Bank 0 subsystem.  The layout of
 * registers follows the list of registers in Sect. 2.19.6 of the
 * RP2040 datasheet.  The facade is in particular intended for use by
 * the SDK.
 *
 * Note: This class implements only a subset of the RP2040 GPIO set of
 * registers, focussing on those registers that are relevant for PIO
 * simulation.  All GPIO registers specified by the RP2040 datasheet
 * are addressable, but writing to non-relevant registers or register
 * bits will have no effect, and reading from non-relevant registers
 * or register bits will return a constant value of 0.
