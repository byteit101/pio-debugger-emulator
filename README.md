# RP2040 PIO Emulator

An emulator of the RP2040 state machines, useful for testing and
debugging new PIO code at _low_ speed.

This emulator is _not_ intended as a real-time emulation of the actual
hardware, but just as a handy tool for understanding how the PIO works
and for testing and debugging when developing code for the PIO.
